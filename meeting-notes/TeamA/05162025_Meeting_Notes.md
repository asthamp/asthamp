## Discussion Summary

This was the kick-off meeting for Team A. Alyssa presented a PowerPoint to anchor the agenda items for discussion. The meeting started with introductions and sharing expectations for the capstone project.

An overview of MS Teams and GitHub was provided to show where collaboration will occur. The team agreed on one **mandatory meeting** and one **optional office hours** meeting each week. Everyone is expected to record availability on the Team Roster.

Technical lead roles were assigned with a shared responsibility approach—everyone will contribute to all project areas. Lead roles exist to ensure quality and completeness for specific technical components.

Milestone 1 was discussed, and Roy recommended a **joint stakeholder meeting** with Team A and Team B. The **Milestone 1 due date is May 31st**, and deliverables include the **Project Plan** and **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** documents.

The meeting ended with a Q&A and closing thoughts. Action items are listed below.
